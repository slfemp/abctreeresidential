           <h3>Dead Trees</h3>
           <p>Every homeowner or commercial property manager
             hates to see a tree die.  The sad fact is that
             sometimes trees do die.  Once a tree has died,
             there is nothing more to doâ€¦except take it down.
             Removal is necessary because a dead tree will slowly lose strength.
             As the tree weakens, it loses its ability to withstand the assault
             of storms or extra weight.  Snow, ice, storms, and winds can break
             off branches or bring down a dead tree.  The fall of a dead tree or
             even a branch can cause extensive damage to nearby houses, cars,
             or even people.  Dead trees represent a tremendous potential
             liability and should be removed as soon as reasonably possible. </p>
