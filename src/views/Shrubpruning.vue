           <h3>Shrub Pruning promotes tree health.</h3>
           <p>Pruning is a horticultural and silvicultural practice
             involving the selective removal of certain parts of a plant,
             such as branches, buds, or roots. The practice entails
             targeted removal of diseased, damaged, dead, non-productive,
             structurally unsound, or otherwise unwanted tissue from crop
             and landscape plants. In general, the smaller the branch that is cut,
             the easier it is for a woody plant to compartmentalize the wound
             and thus limit the potential for pathogen intrusion
             and decay. It is therefore preferable to make any
             necessary formative structural pruning cuts to young plants,
             rather than removing large, poorly placed branches from mature plants.
