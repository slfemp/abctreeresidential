           <h3>Storm Preparation</h3>
           <p>Drastic weather changes can happen at any time.
             Storms may blow away entire trees and cause them to
             land on homes, cars, and other structures.
             Prepare your trees for the bad weather with our
             storm preparation services.</p>
            <p>
            Our services include preventive tree pruning to improve
            your tree’s wind resistance, which will lessen the
            chance of damage. In addition, we protect the tree’s
            root system with a mulch ring around its base.
            We’ll also determine if a tree should be removed or not.</p>

            <h3>Storm Clean Up</h3>
            <p>In the aftermath of a hurricane or tropical storm,
              damage is almost always a certainty.
              After every storm, our team is in the field working
              to clean up uprooted trees and debris that have
              littered the roadways, caused blockages, landed on homes, ect.
              </p><p>
              If you find yourself impacted by any of the
              above mentioned damages after a storm, give
              us a call so that we can deploy our team
              to provide emergency assistance.</p>
